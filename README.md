Student-Teacher Evaulutaion Visualization -> "Steve"  

A project to create a better data visualization for anonymous student reviews of professors/courses/departments at the University of Oklahoma. The reviews are currently available in individual, non-queryable pdfs (a collection of thousands of pdfs) at the following website - http://www.ou.edu/provost/course-evaluation-data. We want to create a data visualization to present this information and make it accessible to students.  

Website is available [here](http://35.193.175.5).  

Api backend is available here [here](http://35.188.130.122/api/v0).

In the project directory, you can run: **use yarn**
