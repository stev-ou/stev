# ou_student_reviews_db
A project to create a better data visualization for anonymous student reviews of professors/courses/departments at the University of Oklahoma. The reviews are currently available in individual, non-queryable pdfs (a collection of ~730 pdfs) at the following website - http://www.ou.edu/provost/course-evaluation-data. We want to create a data visualization to present this information and make it accessible to students.

## Building  
Clone repo and make venv for python (assumes python 3.7.0) and install requirements  
```python3
python3 -m venv env  
source env/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
