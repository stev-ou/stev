# OU Student Reviews Database and Visualization 
This is a project to create better data visualization for anonymous student reviews of professors/courses/departments at the University of Oklahoma. The reviews are currently available in individual, non-queryable pdfs (a collection of ~730 pdfs) at the following website - http://www.ou.edu/provost/course-evaluation-data.  

There are two main goals of the project:  
1. Obtain data and store in a database for easy processing/presentation/addition  
2. Create a frontend for data visualization and make it accessible to students
