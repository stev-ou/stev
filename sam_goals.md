# Sam Jett's Project Goals

**Through completing this project, I would like to:** 
- Learn to access, add data to, and read data from a database  
- Learn to use JS or JS frameworks for data representation and visualization online  
- Work collaboratively, principally with Zach S but with any of our friends (Tony or Joe) that might like to work on the project. This includes documenting my code more fully, using GitHub to better keep up with the project status, and using branching to maintain a functional codebase while developing.  
- Market this service to OU students so that people actually start to use this data to inform their decisions, and hopeully hold departments accountable when they continually schedule a teacher with very low ratings to teach a course. Additionally, marketing is not something that comes naturally to me, so it would be a good chance to work on my weaknesses.  

Most importantly, I would like to use this project as an opportunity to provide this review visualization service for OU students, because I think it could be an awesome tool to have, and I wish I had it when I was making decisions about courses.
