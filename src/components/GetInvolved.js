      <p>
        Thanks for your interest in contributing to the STEV project! There are
        a number of opportunities to contribute, no matter your skillset. Those
        with software development experience are encouraged to jump into the
        code and submit a pull request (more on that{' '}
        <a href="#pull-requests">below</a>). For those with non-technical
        backgrounds, there are still a number of ways to contribute to the
        project through sharing the website with OU students, finding bugs, or
        suggesting content improvements. The recommended ways to get involved
        are listed below.{' '}

      <h3>Current Contribution Suggestions</h3>

        <i>Updated Summer 2019</i>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <b>Sharing the Website:</b> The easiest way for you to contribute to
          and be a part of this project is to share the link with your friends
          and peers at OU. The more people who are behind this project, the more
          support we will have in encouraging OU administrators to provide
          broader datasets toward improving the website's features.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Bug Tracking:</b> If you discover a bug with the application, we
          would appreciate your feedback so the bug can be fixed. In order to
          report a bug, please create an issue on our{' '}

          >

          </a>
          , including in the description the steps required to reproduce the
          unintented behavior.{' '}
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Lack of Data:</b> If you notice a lack of data (you search for a
          course/ instructor and it does not exist in our system), create an
          issue in the same way as above, including the data you expected and
          what you received (if any). This is especially valuable since our team
          has continually attempted to work with the university, with very
          little receptivity or action on the university's behalf. As we collect
          more information about the demand for missing evaluations, we gain
          further support for our efforts to gather more data from OU.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Suggesting Improvements:</b> If you have a suggestion for an
          improvement to the site, we encourage you to submit an issue on our{' '}

          with the label "enhancement", where developers will be able to discuss
          and hopefully implement your request!
