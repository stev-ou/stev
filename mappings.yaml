# Builds necessary dictionaries to allow mapping of values from the output data to courses, instructors, etc.

# 
# The term code dict maps the term code (6 digit code) to a more readable format (e.g., Spring 2017)
Term_code_dict: {201720: 'Spring 2018'} # Need to fill this out with all term codes we will receive
College_code_dict: {'EN': 'GCOE'}

# This dictionary below shows the desired output mappings for each column in aggregated data, alongside a brief description
# Ag_df_indices:{0: 'Term Code',
# 1: 'College Code', etc.}

# This dictionary will show the weight given to each question response when determining the overall student review of the instructor/course
# This maps the questions to 
Instructor_question_weighting: {1: 0, 2: 0.15, 3: 0.20, 4: 0, 5: 0.15, 6: 0.15, 7: 0, 8: 0, 9: 0, 10: 0.35} # Currently only 2,3,5,6,10 are in our data

# I don't think we will need to use the below dictionary
# Department_code_dict: {'EN00': 'ENGR', 'EN01': 'AME', 'EN02': 'CH E', 'EN03':'CEES'}
